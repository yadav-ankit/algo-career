/*
The longest palindromic subsequence of a string is the longest common subsequence of the given string and its reverse.

/*

In order to minimize the insertions, we need to find the length of the longest palindromic component or in other words, the longest palindromic subsequence.

Minimum Insertion required = n(length of the string) - length of longest palindromic subsequence. (see above)
